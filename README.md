# Screen-Snake
Recreation of classic screen snake game implemented in LÃ–VE, a 2D game engine for the programming language Lua. The game features a snake that moves across the screen and consumes food to grow longer. The snake's movement can be controlled by the player using the ASWD keys. The game has two modes: "wallCollision" and "wallTele". In "wallCollision" mode, the snake dies upon touching the walls of the game window, while in "wallTele" mode, the snake teleports to the opposite side of the window when it touches the walls. The game also keeps track of the player's score, which increases by 1 for each piece of food the snake consumes. The game has a start screen and a game over screen, both of which display the score and offer the option to start a new game.
