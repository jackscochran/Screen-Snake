# Screen-Snake
Recreation of classic screen snake game

Uses Object-Oriented principles to make code more managable. The snake resembles a singly linked list, however I created this code before my data structures course so this was unintentional and therefore is a bit of an informal linked list. In order to play first download the love application and make sure all the files are in one folder. Then simply drag the folder onto the love application.
